# Analyzing $SPY Price with Python

This project analyzes historical prices of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ($SPY) using Python's yfinance and pmdarima packages to build classical time series ARIMA models, perform model diagnostics, and make and evaluate forecasts using MSE and MAPE.

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

yfinance

pmdarima

matplotlib

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

## Usage

To use the code, simply run the data_pull.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions for downloading the $SPY data, performing exploratory data analysis, building ARIMA models, performing model diagnostics, making forecasts, and evaluating the accuracy of the forecasts.
